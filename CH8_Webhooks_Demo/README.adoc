= Preparing the Demo

.Run the Lab Setup playbook
[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation ~]$ lab start code-webhooks

[IMPORTANT]
======
The *ansible-navigator.yml* file specifies using the *hub.lab.example.com/ee-supported-rhel8:latest* which contains all collections needed to run the playbooks. By this point in the course, the EEI should already be available and downloaded and you should have already authenticated to *hub.lab.example.com*. However, if the environment was re-created or you are delivering RHLS Premium, it is possible that you might need to login to Private Automation Hub.

.Logging into Private Automation Hub
[source,bash]
----
[student@workstation Webhooks]$ podman login hub.lab.example.com
Username: admin
Password:
Login Succeeded!

After logging in, you should be able to run the *Site.yml* playbook.
